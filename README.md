Greetings 👋🏼 - my name is Marian 👩🏼‍💻 and I recently embarked on a journey to level up my SQL game by starting the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma. 
<br><br>
This repository contains all my documentation for the challenges that I have completed so far. Keep watching 👀 this space as I add on more solutions.

### `My Process`
Solutions were coded in [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) syntax.<br>

Each case-study folder contains the following files
- **data.sql**: compiled sql for creating tables & loading data 
- **datacleaning.sql**: compiled sql for cleaning data
- **solution.sql**: compiled sql for answering the challenge questions

My code was written in a [Count](https://count.co/) SQL notebook. 

From there I copied the compiled SQL to a *.sql file which you can view in the individual challenge folders. 

I also copied the markdown from the notebook to a [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) doc to which I added some additional formatting together with the screenshots and/or csv downloads so you can see tabular output from the individual notebook cells.

### `The Challenges`
