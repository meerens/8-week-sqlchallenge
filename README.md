These are my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma

Each case-study folder contains the following files

- csv files for the different tables in the schema
- the solution file (.sql) containing the sql code

Solutions were coded in Google BigQuery

For more context, code comments and lessons learnt ... check the links to the SQL notebooks
