These are my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma

Solutions were prepared in Snowflake using a [trial account](https://signup.snowflake.com/)

Each challenge folder contains the following files
- csv files for the different tables in the schema
- the solution file (.sql) containing the sql code for creating the database/schemas/tables and answering the different questions
- data from the csv files were loaded into the corresponding tables using the web-ui
