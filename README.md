## Introduction

These are my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma

Each case-study folder contains the following files

- data.sql: code for creating tables & loading data 
- datacleaning.sql: code for cleaning data
- solution.sql: code for answering the challenge questions

Solutions were coded in [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax)
