These are my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma

Each case-study folder contains the following files

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- csv files for the different tables in the schema
- the solution file (*.sql) containing the compiled sql code
=======
- data.sql: code for creating tables & loading data 
- datacleaning.sql: code for cleaning data
- solution.sql: code for answering the questions
- notebook.md: markdown from the sql notebooks
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Solutions were coded in Google BigQuery

For more context, code comments and lessons learnt ... check the links to the SQL notebooks
